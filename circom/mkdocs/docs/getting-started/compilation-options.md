    -p, --prime <prime>                      To choose the prime number to use to generate the circuit. Receives the
                                             name of the curve (bn128, bls12381, goldilocks, grumpkin, secq256r1, pallas, vesta) [default: bn128]

ARGS:
    <input>    Path to a circuit with a main component [default: ./circuit.circom]
```

In the following, we explain these options.


##### Flags and options related to the compiler's output
* Flag ```--r1cs``` outputs the constraints in binary R1CS format (see the detailed format [here](https://github.com/iden3/r1csfile/blob/master/doc/r1cs_bin_format.md)).
* Flag ```--sym``` outputs for every signal of the circuit: the unique number given by the compiler, the circom qualified name, the number of the witness signal that contains it and the (unique) number of the component (given by the compiler) it belongs (see the detailed format and examples [here](../circom-language/formats/sym.md)).
* Flag ```--simplification_substitution``` outputs the substitutions performed by the --O1 and --O2 (default) constraint simplification options in json format (see the detailed format [here](../circom-language/formats/simplification-json.md)).
* Flag ```--wasm``` produces a WebAssembly program that receives the private and public inputs and generates the circuit witness.
* Flag ```-c / --c``` produces a C++ program that receives the private and public inputs and generates the circuit witness.
* Flag ```--wat``` compiles the circuit to wat.
* Flag ```--json``` outputs the R1CS system in JSON format (see the detailed format [here](../circom-language/formats/constraints-json.md)).
* Option ```-o / --output <output>``` allows to indicate the path to the directory where the output will be written. By default the path is ```.```. 

##### Flags and options related to the constraint generation process
* Flag ```--verbose``` shows logs with known values at compilation time during the constraint generation process. 
* Flag ```--inspect``` does an additional check over the R1CS system produced. (see [--inspect](../circom-language/code-quality/inspect.md)).
* Flag ```--use_old_simplification_heuristics``` allows to use an old heuristics of the optimization algorithm. However, it is not recommended since the new heuristics has produced better results in practice.


##### Flags and options related to the R1CS optimization
In the following, we explain the different optimizations that we can apply to the final R1CS during the constraint generation phase. More details on the simplification process can be found [here](../circom-language/circom-insight/simplification.md)

* Flag ```--O0``` does not apply any kind of simplification.
  
* Flag ```--O1``` removes two kinds of simple constraints: a) ```signal = K```, being K is a constant in $F_p$ and b) ```signal1 = signal2```, which usually appears when linking components inputs and outputs. 
  
* Flag ```--O2``` applies Gauss elimination to remove as many linear constraints as possible. After applying the substitutions discovered by the algorithm, non-linear constraints may become linear. Thus, the Gauss elimination is applied during several rounds until no more linear constraints are discovered.

* Option ```--O2round <simplification_rounds>``` is similar to ```--O2```but it limits the maximum number of rounds applied during the optimization. In ```<simplification_rounds>```, user needs to indicate the number of rounds. 

Only one of these flags/options must be used during the compilation.

##### Other flags and options
* Option ```-p, --prime <prime>``` allows the user indicate which prime must be used during the compilation. Currently, it admits six different primes: bn128, bls12381, goldilock, grumpkin, secq256r1, pallas and vesta. If not indicated, the default prime is bn128.

* Option ```-l <link_libraries>``` adds the provided directory in ```<link_libraries>```to the library search path. It is possible to add as much ```-l <link_libraries>``` as needed, but only one directory per option.

* Flag ```-v / --version``` prints the version information.
* Flag ```-h / --help``` prints the help information.
